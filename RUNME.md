I did not have time to use docker.

Dependencies:
* pandas
* os
* seaborn
* numpy
* sklearn - v0.22.2 (this is latest version and is needed for confusion matrix)
* matplotlib

If you clone the repository make sure you run from `.../CEBD1160-MyProject`. For example in a terminal
go to `.../CEBD1160-MyProject` and run `python Employee-Flight-Risk_Analysis.py`
