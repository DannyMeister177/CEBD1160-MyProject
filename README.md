## Research Question

<b>What are the most important factors predicting employee flight (attrition)?</b>

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

Predicting employee flight is a principal concern of Human Resource departments as it is typically 
very costly to replace employees. According to 
[this article](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/312123/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee), 
the average cost to replace an employee is "20 percent of annual salary for midrange positions 
(earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year). For example, the cost to replace a $40k manager would be 
$8,000." according to one study. Using the dataset which has fictional employee data along with 
attrition I attempted to determine which factors can help predict employee flight. I found it very 
challenging as the data is significantly imbalanced (only 16% of employees left) and so 
<b><i>RESULT TBD</i></b>

### Introduction

This is a fictional dataset created by IBM Data Scientists found on can be found on 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). 
It holds 1470 employee records with various HR factors such as compensation, Demographics, 
Measures of environmental satisfaction, performance, work experience, and more along with whether 
the employee left the company or not.

### Methods

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:
