## Research Question

<b>"What are the most important factors predicting employee flight (attrition)?"</b>

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)



### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

This is a fictional dataset created by IBM Data Scientists found on Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). 
It holds 1470 employee records with various HR factors such as compensation, Demographics
, Measures of environmental satisfaction, performance, work experience, and more. We can use this
 data to create a model to identify important factors that can predict employee flight which is a principal concern of Human Resource departments as it is typically very costly to replace employees. According to [this article](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/312123/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee), the average cost to replace an employee is "20 percent of annual salary for midrange positions (earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year). For example, the cost to replace a $40k manager would be $8,000." according to one study.

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
